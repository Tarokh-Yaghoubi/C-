# Defined Terms in Chapter One 

```
	Argument : Value passed to the function


```

```
	Assignment : Obliterates an objects current value and replaces that
	value with a new one 

```

```
	Block : Sequence of zero or more statements enclosed in braces 

```

```
	Buffer : A region of storage used to hold data . IO facilities often 
	store input or output , in a buffer or read or write the buffer 
	independently from actions in the program . Output buffers can be 
	explicitly flushed to force the buffer to be written . By default ,
	reading cin flushed cout; cout is also flushed when the program
	ends normally .


```

```
	Built-In Types : Type , such as int , defined by the language 

```

```

	Cerr : cerr is an object of ostream tied to standard error, which often
	writes to the same device as standard output. By default , writes to the
	cerr are not buffered .Usually used for error messages or other output 
	that are not part of the normal logic of the program . 

```
<br />
**Character String Literal is another TERM for String Literal**
<br />

```
	Cin : ostream object that is used to read from the standard input 

```

```
	Class : Facility for defining our own data structures together with
	associated operations . The Class is one of the most fundamental
	features in C++ . Library types ; such as ostream and istream , are
	classes .

```

```
	Class Type : A type defined by a class . the name of the type is
	the class name . 

```

```
	Clog : ostream object tied to the standard error . by default writes 
	to the clog are buffered . Usually used to report information about 
	program execution to a log file . 

```

```
	Comments : Program text that is ignored by the compiler . C++ has two 
	types of comments : single-line and paired . Single line comments start
	with a // . Everything from the // to the end of the line is a comment .
	Paired comments start with a /* and include all the text from the /* to
	the next */ .

```

```

	Condition : An expression that is evaluated as true of false . A value 
	of zero is false . any other value yields true ;

```

```
	Cout : ostream object , used to write to the standard output .
	Ordinarily used to write the output of a program . 

```

```

	Data Structure : A logical grouping of data and operation on that 
	data .

```

```
	Edit-Compile-Debug : The process of getting a program to execute
	properly .

```

```

	End-Of-File EOF : System-specific marker that indicates that there is 
	no more input in a file .

```

```

	Expression : The smallest unit of computation . an expression consists
	of one or more operands and usually one or more operators . 
	Expressions are evaluated to product a result .

```

```
	For Statement : Iteration statement that provides iterative execution .
	Often used to repeat a calculation , a fixed number of times .

```

```
	Function : Named unit of computation .

```

```

	Function Body : Block that defines the actions performed by a function .

```

```
	Function Name : Name by which a function is known and can be called . 

```

```

	Header :  Mechanism whereby the definitions of a class or other names
	are made available to multiple programs. 
	A program uses a header through a #include directive.

```

```

	Namespace : Mechanism for putting names defined by a library into
	a single place. Namespaces help avoid inadvertent name clashes. 
	The names defined by the C++ library are in the namespace std.

```
